# Arrays Operation
## Adding an item: O(1)
We can keep adding values to the Array as far as Array is not full.
Soo,when adding new values to the list,we just have to insert it with the next index --> very fast O(1) operation.

## Inserting item O(n)
We would like to insert a given value with a given index here
It is a bit problematic,because we have to shift lots of values in order to be able to insert the new one -->O(n) operation
